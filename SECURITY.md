## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security vulnerabilities within our project, please report them to us immediately.

### How to Report

- GitHub Issues: [Create a new issue](https://github.com/ukrblx/UK-s-Group-Finder/issues/new) with the "Security" label

### Response Time

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide regular updates on our progress in resolving the issue. Please do not publicly disclose any security vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to address them.

### Vulnerability Assessment

Once a vulnerability is reported, we will assess its severity and impact on our project. You can expect one of the following responses:

- **Accepted**: The vulnerability is confirmed, and we will work on a fix immediately.
- **Declined**: The reported issue does not pose a security risk, or it is out of the scope of this policy.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This means that if you discover a vulnerability, you should:

- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before making it public.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of the UK's Group Finder project, including its codebase, documentation, and related resources.
